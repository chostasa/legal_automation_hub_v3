EXAMPLE_DEMAND = """
The snowplow operator owed a clear duty of care to nearby pedestrians and failed to exercise the required standard of care while maneuvering in a populated area. This breach directly caused Jane’s severe orthopedic trauma, neurological harm, and emotional injuries. Liability is clear under established negligence law, and the evidence—including the police report, witness statements, and available video footage—will corroborate Jane’s account. Recovery is warranted for her physical injuries, emotional distress, and significant economic damages.
"""

SETTLEMENT_EXAMPLE = """
This case presents clear liability and catastrophic damages. Jane had no safe alternative but to walk in the street, yet the operator failed to keep a proper lookout and struck her, causing life-altering injuries. 
Her damages include more than $85,000 in medical expenses to date, projected surgical costs exceeding $50,000, significant lost education opportunities, and lifelong pain and suffering. 

A lay jury will empathize with Jane. They will understand the fear of being unseen by a large vehicle and the permanent impact of injuries that rob a young person of normal life. Witness testimony, the police report, and video footage will confirm the defendant’s negligence.

Accordingly, we demand $100,000.00 to resolve this matter, reflecting her economic damages and the profound non-economic harm she has endured. If this demand is not met by [specific deadline], we will initiate litigation and pursue the full measure of damages at trial.
