EXAMPLE_DEMAND = """
The snowplow operator owed a duty of care to nearby pedestrians and failed to exercise the required standard of care while maneuvering in a populated area. This breach was the direct and proximate cause of Jane’s orthopedic trauma and emotional harm. Accordingly, liability is established under applicable tort law.
"""


SETTLEMENT_EXAMPLE = """
This is not a complicated case, and a jury will easily be able to conclude that the snowplow operator acted negligently and, as a result, Jane was seriously injured. Jane, like many pedestrians, had no safe option but to walk in the street. Despite this, the operator failed to see her, ultimately running her over and leaving her pinned beneath the vehicle.

A lay jury will empathize with Jane. Many people have experienced close calls with large vehicles or have struggled to be seen in winter conditions. Moreover, the police arrived at the scene, and potential video footage may corroborate Jane’s account. The damages here are significant and will be difficult for your client to contest.

Based on similar verdicts and settlements for cases involving traumatic injuries, we are authorized to demand the sum of $100,000.00 (One Hundred Thousand Dollars) to resolve this matter. If we do not receive a timely response, we are prepared to proceed with litigation.
