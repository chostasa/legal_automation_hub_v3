# === Core Guidelines for Mediation Memo GPT Prompts (A+ Version) ===

NO_HALLUCINATION_NOTE = """
Do not fabricate or assume any facts. Use only the facts, quotes, and context provided.
Avoid adding headings, greetings, or signoffs — the template will handle those.
Refer to the client by their first name only, consistently throughout the memo.
Maintain consistent names, pronouns, and chronology throughout the document.
Never introduce multiple versions of the same incident.
Do not repeat accident details, injuries, or treatments across sections. Each fact or quote must only appear once.
"""

UNIVERSAL_INSTRUCTION = """
All content must reflect formal legal writing appropriate for mediation and federal court review.
Never fabricate names, facts, injuries, or legal positions. If unsure, omit rather than guess.
Use active voice exclusively. Each sentence must advance legal theory, factual support, or damages.
All quotes must be verbatim from deposition or complaint excerpts and cited in the format (Ex. A, [Name] Dep. [Line]).
Each section must serve a unique purpose. Eliminate any duplication of facts or quotes from prior sections.
The memo must read as if reviewed and edited by a managing partner before submission.
"""

LEGAL_FLUENCY_NOTE = """
Write with the clarity and authority of a senior trial attorney. Analyze facts through the legal framework of duty, breach, causation, and harm.
Eliminate redundancy, vague language, and casual storytelling. Maintain a formal, persuasive, and polished tone throughout.
Quantify damages wherever possible. Reference witnesses, police, and evidence only once, in the most relevant section.
Do not re-list injuries in multiple sections. Fully detail injuries once, then reference them by category (e.g., “orthopedic trauma,” “cognitive impairments”).
Avoid weak or speculative language such as “we believe,” “it may be,” “potential footage,” or “appears to be.”
Use strong, assertive alternatives:
- “The evidence shows…”
- “Liability is established by…”
- “This testimony confirms…”

End the memo firmly and succinctly:
“We invite resolution of this matter without litigation. Should you fail to respond by [date], we are prepared to proceed accordingly.”
"""

BAN_PHRASING_NOTE = """
Ban speculative or weakening language: “may,” “might,” “potential,” “appears to,” “possibly,” “believes that.”
Replace with assertive phrasing: “is,” “will show,” “demonstrates,” “establishes.”
"""

FORBIDDEN_PHRASES = """
Never use the following:
- “continues to discover injuries”
- “a host of”
- “significant emotional hardship”
- “cannot be overlooked”
- “it is clear that”
- “ongoing discomfort”
- “found herself”
- “left her with”
- “had to”
- “was forced to”
- “Jane was returning”
- “she elected to”
- “engrossed in conversation”
- “was caught off guard”
"""

NO_PASSIVE_LANGUAGE_NOTE = """
All sentences must use active voice. 
Do not write “was struck” or “has been advised.”
Instead: “The snowplow struck Jane,” or “Jane is consulting medical specialists…”
"""

STRUCTURE_GUIDE_NOTE = """
Follow a clear legal analysis structure in each section: duty → breach → causation → harm.
Each section must serve a unique purpose, and no facts or quotes may be repeated from prior sections.
"""

LEGAL_TRANSITION_NOTE = """
Use clear, assertive legal transitions:
- “This breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of…”
- “Accordingly, liability is established under…”
- “Based on these facts, recovery is warranted under…”
Transitions must link sections smoothly and maintain persuasive flow.
"""

QUOTE_EMBEDDING_NOTE = """
All deposition and complaint excerpts must:
- Be quoted exactly (verbatim)
- Be embedded naturally within the narrative (not bullet points)
- Include proper citations (Ex. A, [Name] Dep. [Line])
- Be unique to the section (no duplicate quotes across sections)
Each Facts/Liability and Harms section must contain at least three embedded direct quotes supporting the argument.
"""

PARAGRAPHING_AND_FLOW_NOTE = """
Break paragraphs into smaller sections (2–4 sentences each) for readability. 
Each paragraph must focus on a single idea and transition cleanly to the next. 
Do not allow overly dense blocks of text. 
Use transitional phrases to tie together damages, impact on quality of life, and earning capacity into a cohesive story.
"""

SECTION_SPECIFIC_NOTE = """
Each section must meet the following:
- **Introduction:** Frame case posture and value in a concise, high-level overview. Avoid detailed facts or injuries.
- **Parties:** Briefly introduce each Plaintiff and Defendant with their role and responsibilities. Avoid accident facts or duplicating information from other sections.
- **Demand:** Summarize settlement posture in two clear sentences. Objective tone only.
- **Facts/Liability:** Establish duty, breach, and causation in detail. Embed at least three unique quotes.
- **Causation/Injuries:** Connect accident facts to injuries and treatment progression. Avoid rehashing the full accident narrative.
- **Harms:** Show how injuries impact the client’s professional, functional, and emotional life. Embed at least three unique quotes. Avoid reading like a medical record; tell the client’s story persuasively.
- **Future Medical:** Outline anticipated care and costs, tying them directly to the client’s life impact. Keep concise and persuasive.
- **Conclusion:** Summarize settlement demand in one or two sentences. Avoid repeating facts and end firmly with litigation readiness language.
