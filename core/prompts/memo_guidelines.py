NO_HALLUCINATION_NOTE = """
Do not fabricate or assume any facts. Use only what is provided. Avoid headings, greetings, and signoffs — the template handles those.
Refer to the client by their first name only. Keep all naming, pronouns, and chronology consistent.
Do not use more than one version of the incident. Do not repeat injury or treatment details across sections.
Each fact should only appear once in the entire memo. Avoid reintroducing facts or quotes from prior sections.
"""

UNIVERSAL_INSTRUCTION = """
All content must reflect formal legal writing appropriate for submission in federal court.
Do not fabricate names, facts, injuries, or legal positions. If unsure, omit rather than guess.
Use active voice only. Maintain continuity of facts, tone, and case theory across all sections.
All quotes must be direct from deposition or complaint excerpts and cited in the format (Ex. A, [Name] Dep. [Line]).
Every sentence must advance legal theory, factual support, or damages. Never simply restate background information.
The final product must read as if it were reviewed by a managing partner for mediation submission.
"""

LEGAL_FLUENCY_NOTE = """
Use the tone and clarity of a senior litigator. Frame facts persuasively using legal reasoning: duty, breach, causation, and harm.
Eliminate redundancy, vague phrases, and casual storytelling. Frame liability clearly. Maintain formal, polished, and precise language.
Quantify damages where possible. Refer to witnesses, police, and footage only once, in the most relevant section.

Avoid reintroducing the client's injuries more than once. After the initial mention, refer to them only by category (e.g., “orthopedic trauma,” “soft tissue damage,” “ongoing symptoms”).

Eliminate any of the following weak or redundant phrases: “continues to uncover injuries,” “in the process of obtaining,” “we believe,” “potential footage,” or “may have been.”

Use strong, legally assertive alternatives:
- “Reports symptoms consistent with...”
- “Surveillance footage is being secured...”
- “Liability is well-supported by the available evidence...”

In the closing paragraph, avoid overexplaining. End firmly with one or two sentences:
“We invite resolution of this matter without the need for litigation. Should you fail to respond by [date], we are prepared to proceed accordingly.”

All content must sound like it was drafted for final review by a managing partner or trial attorney.
Every sentence should advance legal theory, factual support, or damage justification — never simply repeat facts.

Ensure transitions between sections are smooth, using connective phrasing when appropriate (e.g., 'Following the incident…', 'As detailed above…', 'This context is critical in understanding…').
"""

BAN_PHRASING_NOTE = """
Ban any phrasing that introduces speculation or weakens factual strength. Do not use: “may,” “might,” “potential,” “appears to,” “possibly,” or “believes that.”
Replace all with direct phrasing: “Jane is,” “The evidence will show,” “The footage depicts...”
"""

FORBIDDEN_PHRASES = """
Forbidden: “continues to discover injuries,” “a host of,” “significant emotional hardship,” “cannot be overlooked,”
“it is clear that,” “ongoing discomfort,” “found herself,” “left her with,” “had to,” “was forced to,”
“Jane was returning,” “she elected to,” “engrossed in conversation,” “was caught off guard”
"""

NO_PASSIVE_LANGUAGE_NOTE = """
Every sentence must use active voice. Eliminate all passive constructions.
Do not say “was struck” or “has been advised.” Instead: “The snowplow struck Jane,” or “Jane is gathering...”
"""

STRUCTURE_GUIDE_NOTE = """
Use clear, logical structure to organize the letter sections. Follow legal analysis order: duty, breach, causation, harm.
Ensure each section is focused on its unique purpose and never repeats prior sections’ facts or quotes.
"""

LEGAL_TRANSITION_NOTE = """
Use clear legal transitions such as:
- “This breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of...”
- “Accordingly, liability is established under...”
- “Based on these facts, recovery is warranted under...”
Frame arguments assertively and confidently, avoiding tentative language.
"""

BAN_PHRASES_NOTE = """
Avoid any speculative or weak language: “may,” “might,” “potential,” “appears to,” “possibly,” “believes that.”
Instead, use: “is,” “will show,” “depicts,” “demonstrates.”
"""

QUOTE_EMBEDDING_NOTE = """
All deposition and complaint excerpts must be quoted exactly and embedded naturally within the narrative.
Each Facts/Liability and Harms section must include at least three unique direct quotes. Quotes must:
- Be introduced with context (e.g., “According to [Name], ...”).
- Use exact testimony, not paraphrasing.
- Be cited in the format (Ex. A, [Name] Dep. [Line]).
- Never appear as standalone blocks or bullet points.
- Directly support the factual or legal point being made.
- Do NOT duplicate the same quote across multiple sections.
"""

SECTION_SPECIFIC_NOTE = """
Each section must meet the following:
- **Introduction:** Concisely frame the case value and posture. Do not repeat facts or injuries already covered elsewhere.
- **Demand:** Two sentences summarizing settlement position, objective tone only.
- **Facts/Liability:** Provide detailed narrative establishing duty, breach, and causation. Embed at least three unique quotes.
- **Causation/Injuries:** Connect facts to injuries and treatment. Avoid repeating the full accident narrative.
- **Harms:** Describe functional, professional, and emotional impact. Embed at least three unique quotes.
- **Future Medical:** Outline anticipated care and costs. Reference supporting testimony.
- **Conclusion:** End firmly with litigation readiness language. No overexplaining, no fact repetition.
