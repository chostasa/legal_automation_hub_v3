# === Core Guidelines for Mediation Memo GPT Prompts ===

NO_HALLUCINATION_NOTE = """
Do not fabricate or assume any facts. Use only the facts, quotes, and context provided.
Avoid headings, greetings, or signoffs — the template handles these.
Refer to the client by their first name only, consistently throughout the memo.
Maintain consistent names, pronouns, and chronology.
Never introduce multiple versions of the same incident.
Do not repeat injury, treatment, or accident details across sections. Each fact or quote must only appear once in the entire memo.
"""

UNIVERSAL_INSTRUCTION = """
All content must reflect formal legal writing appropriate for mediation submission and federal court review.
Never fabricate names, facts, injuries, or legal positions. If unsure, omit rather than guess.
Use active voice exclusively. Each sentence must directly advance legal theory, factual support, or damages.
All quotes must be verbatim from deposition or complaint excerpts and cited in the format (Ex. A, [Name] Dep. [Line]).
Every section must serve a unique purpose. Avoid any duplication of facts or quotes from prior sections.
The memo must read as if reviewed and edited by a managing partner before submission.
"""

LEGAL_FLUENCY_NOTE = """
Write with the precision and tone of a senior trial attorney. Use legal reasoning frameworks (duty, breach, causation, harm) in analysis.
Eliminate redundancy, vague phrasing, and casual storytelling. Maintain formal, persuasive, and polished language throughout.
Quantify damages wherever possible. Reference witnesses, police, or evidence only once, in the most relevant section.

Do not re-list injuries in multiple sections. Mention them fully once, then reference them by category (e.g., “orthopedic trauma,” “ongoing cognitive impairments”).

Avoid weak phrases like “we believe,” “it may be,” “continues to uncover injuries,” “potential footage,” “might have been,” or “appears to be.”
Instead, use assertive alternatives:
- “The evidence shows…”
- “Liability is established by…”
- “This testimony confirms…”

Close the memo firmly and succinctly: 
“We invite resolution of this matter without litigation. Should you fail to respond by [date], we are prepared to proceed accordingly.”
"""

BAN_PHRASING_NOTE = """
Ban any speculative or weakening language: “may,” “might,” “potential,” “appears to,” “possibly,” “believes that.”
Replace all with direct phrasing: “is,” “will show,” “depicts,” “demonstrates,” “establishes.”
"""

FORBIDDEN_PHRASES = """
Never use the following:
- “continues to discover injuries”
- “a host of”
- “significant emotional hardship”
- “cannot be overlooked”
- “it is clear that”
- “ongoing discomfort”
- “found herself”
- “left her with”
- “had to”
- “was forced to”
- “Jane was returning”
- “she elected to”
- “engrossed in conversation”
- “was caught off guard”
"""

NO_PASSIVE_LANGUAGE_NOTE = """
All sentences must be active voice. 
Do not say “was struck” or “has been advised.” 
Use: “The snowplow struck Jane,” or “Jane is consulting medical specialists…”
"""

STRUCTURE_GUIDE_NOTE = """
Follow a clear legal analysis order in structuring sections: duty → breach → causation → harm.
Each section must serve a unique purpose, never repeating prior sections' facts or quotes.
"""

LEGAL_TRANSITION_NOTE = """
Use strong legal transitions:
- “This breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of…”
- “Accordingly, liability is established under…”
- “Based on these facts, recovery is warranted under…”
Transitions must connect sections and arguments smoothly while maintaining forceful advocacy.
"""

QUOTE_EMBEDDING_NOTE = """
All deposition and complaint excerpts must:
- Be quoted exactly (verbatim)
- Be embedded naturally within narrative sentences
- Include proper citations (Ex. A, [Name] Dep. [Line])
- Never appear as standalone bullets or blocks
- Directly support the section's legal or factual point
- Be unique to that section (no duplicate quotes across sections)
Each Facts/Liability and Harms section must contain at least three embedded direct quotes.
"""

SECTION_SPECIFIC_NOTE = """
Each section has the following purpose:
- **Introduction:** Concisely frame case value and posture. No fact or injury repetition.
- **Demand:** Summarize settlement posture in 2 sentences, objective tone only.
- **Facts/Liability:** Establish duty, breach, and causation. Embed at least 3 unique quotes.
- **Causation/Injuries:** Link facts to injuries and treatment progression. Do not rehash full accident narrative.
- **Harms:** Show professional, functional, and emotional impact. Embed at least 3 unique quotes.
- **Future Medical:** Outline future care, costs, and supporting testimony. Keep concise.
- **Conclusion:** Summarize settlement demand and end firmly with litigation readiness language. Avoid fact repetition.
