# === Demand Letter Prompt Guidelines (A+++) ===

NO_HALLUCINATION_NOTE = """
Do not fabricate, assume, or infer any facts not provided. Use only the information given, even if incomplete.
Never add headings, greetings, or signoffs — the template will control those elements.
Refer to the client by their first name only. Maintain consistent names, pronouns, and chronology throughout.
Do not present multiple versions of the same event or injury — use only one version of the incident.
"""

STRUCTURE_GUIDE_NOTE = """
Follow this sequence exactly — each section must add new substance and avoid repetition:
1. **Introduction** – Briefly frame the defendant’s duty of care and the context of the incident in 2-3 sentences. Do NOT make a settlement demand in this section.
2. **Facts / Liability** – Provide the complete liability narrative: duty, breach, and direct causation, supported by specific facts and evidence. Avoid damages detail here beyond minimal context.
3. **Damages** – Describe how the injuries and harm impact the client’s physical, emotional, and economic life. Do NOT repeat the full liability narrative. Summarize injuries by category (e.g., orthopedic trauma, neurological harm) without re-listing every detail unless essential to causation or damages.
4. **Settlement Demand** – State the total demand amount with explicit quantification (medical expenses to date, projected medical care, lost wages, and pain & suffering). Do not re-argue liability or re-list injuries here — tie damages directly to the requested amount.

Each section must build on the prior section. Do NOT repeat facts, injuries, or legal arguments verbatim in multiple sections. Use linking transitions to create a logical escalation.
"""

LEGAL_FLUENCY_NOTE = """
Write as if you are a senior trial attorney addressing opposing counsel. 
Use the negligence framework (duty, breach, causation, harm) clearly and persuasively.
Be precise, assertive, and legally confident — avoid vague, clinical, or apologetic language.
Quantify damages explicitly when available: separate past medical expenses, projected costs, lost wages, and pain & suffering. 
Do NOT repeat injury descriptions in full more than once — after the initial description, refer back by category only.
Reference corroborating evidence (police reports, witnesses, photographs, video, etc.) only once for maximum impact.
"""

LEGAL_TRANSITION_NOTE = """
Use strong legal transitions to connect facts and conclusions:
- "This breach of duty directly caused…"
- "Accordingly, liability is clearly established under…"
- "Based on these facts, full recovery is warranted under…"
- "These injuries have profoundly disrupted…"

Never hedge with tentative or speculative transitions.
"""

NO_PASSIVE_LANGUAGE_NOTE = """
Write exclusively in active voice. 
Example:
❌ "Jane was struck by the snowplow."
✅ "The snowplow struck Jane."
"""

BAN_PHRASES_NOTE = """
Avoid weak or speculative words such as: "may," "might," "potential," "appears to," "possibly," "believes that."
Replace them with confident terms: "is," "will show," "demonstrates," "establishes."
"""

FINAL_POLISH_NOTE = """
Each paragraph must advance the legal theory or the damages claim — no filler sentences. 
Do NOT repeat the same injuries, facts, or legal points in multiple sections. Summarize instead of repeating.
Trim unnecessary clinical or technical details unless they directly strengthen causation or damages.
Maintain a persuasive tone that escalates logically toward the demand.
End with a tight, quantified settlement demand that ties the injuries and damages directly to the requested amount.
