NAME, 

As you are aware, our office represents John Doe, in his claim for damages sustained as a result of your insured, Paul Peter, who is liable for negligently causing Mr. Doe’s bicycle to crash into his vehicle on August 21, 2023.	

On August 21, 2023, Mr. Doe was wearing a helmet and riding his bicycle south on Milwaukee Avenue on his way to work. Mr. Peter was driving northbound on Milwaukee Avenue and attempted to turn west onto Concord Plaza. Mr. Peter negligently failed to check the southbound bike lane before making this turn, causing Mr. Doe to slam on the brakes of his bicycle. Mr. Doe did not have time to come to a full stop and crashed into the rear of Mr. Peter’s vehicle. The collision caused John to be launched forward off of his bike, striking his face on the pavement. Mr. Doe laid on the ground until EMS arrived and was placed in a C-collar (Ex. A – Traffic Crash Report).

   


Liability here is clear, Mr. Doe was obeying traffic laws and operating his bicycle with care. Mr. Peter failed to check for oncoming bikes before making the turn, leaving Mr. Doe’s safety in jeopardy and resulting in a severe laceration under Mr. Doe’s right eye and bruising throughout his entire body. 

Following the collision, Mr. Doe was transported to Stroger Hospital where he was treated for three lacerations on the right side of his face. These lacerations required a total of 14 sutures. Mr. Doe experienced decreased vision out of his right eye. John was administered acetaminophen, fentanyl, and epinephrine-lidocaine. X-Rays of John’s Chest and Pelvis were performed along with a CT scan of his face. At the time of discharge, John was diagnosed with trauma, and instructed to follow up with his primary care physician and to return in 7-10 days for the removal of his stitches. (Ex.

On August 30, 2023, Mr. Doe visited Northwestern Medicine to have the sutures removed from all three of his facial lacerations. At this point Mr. Doe was advised to follow-up with an ophthalmologist and a dermatologist. Additionally, Mr. Doe was advised to use a silicone-based scar reduction agent and referred to a plastic surgeon for scar revision. (Ex. D – Northwestern Medicine Medical Records, Ex.

On September 7, 2023, Mr. Doe visited Pinnacle dermatology for a wound check in relation to the three lacerations on his face.

Mr. Doe was also advised to see wither a plastic surgeon or an oculist surgeon for scar revision. (Ex. F – Dermatology Physicians Group (Pinnacle) Medical Records, Ex.
